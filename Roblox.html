                    In terms of games are good, graphics are okay, can also play with friends. The problem is only in the connection like to suddenly break though Wi-Fi and data is safe, and then from the camera also like to zoom in zoom out itself, the last push button jump like can not be pressed or sometimes like to jump alone though not pressed .

                    It's really good to be able to play together, you can underestimate Sakura School Simulator, but there are bugs, for example: when you've exited the map, you enter the map again, and when you die, you suddenly jump by yourself, please fix it, and why are words that are not rude suddenly censored, please learn Indonesian again, once again please fix Roblox, that's all and thank you

                    To be honest, this game is really good, there are many maps, it's cool, I can still make many friends, I can make foreign languages ​​fluent and this game made me speak English! But the shortcoming is in the bug section because there are some bugs that can't be fixed so when I'm having fun playing sometimes I like to get annoying bugs but I really like everything, Cheers to developers, by the way, don't forget to download it!
